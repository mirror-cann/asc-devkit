# Compatibility Guide Example Introduction

## Overview

This section provides several examples for features that are incompatible with Atlas A2 Training Series Products/Atlas A2 Inference Series Products and Ascend 950PR/Ascend 950DT. Users can migrate according to the examples.

This section uses the `<<<>>>` kernel call operator to complete the basic flow of running operator kernel functions on the NPU side, providing corresponding end-to-end implementations.
