# PyTorch Sample Introduction

## Overview

This directory introduces different modes for integrating Ascend C custom operators into the PyTorch framework.

- Integration into PyTorch Eager mode
    - Register an operator into PyTorch through pybind11
    - Register an operator into PyTorch through torch.library
- Integration into PyTorch graph mode
    - Integrate an operator into TorchAir through GE
