# Vector Compute API Samples

## Overview

This directory contains samples for multiple APIs related to vector computation. Each sample is based on Ascend C's `<<<>>>` direct invocation method, supporting both main function and kernel function implementation in the same cpp file.

## Operator Development Samples
