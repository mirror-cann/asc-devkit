# Matmul L0 Cache Direct Invocation Example
## Overview
A Matmul example that enables the L0 cache feature to reduce redundant MTE1 transfers. Taking the left matrix A as an example, L0 cache refers to the MTE1 transfer process where data is moved from A1 to A2. After the data in A1 is transferred to A2, the cached data remains in A2, and the cached data sequentially performs multiply-accumulate operations with different data in B2.

L0 cache does not have an external switch. The Matmul API internally determines whether L0 cache can be enabled based on the shape information configured by the user. Currently, only L0A cache is supported, and the enabling requirements are as follows:
- All Tiling parameters must be configured as constants, that is, singleCoreM/singleCoreN/singleCoreK and baseM/baseN/baseK must all be set through constant interfaces;
- singleCoreM=baseM and singleCoreK=baseK.  

## Supported Products and CANN Versions

| Product | CANN Version |
|------|-------------|
| Ascend 950PR/Ascend 950DT | >= CANN 9.1.0 |
| Atlas A3 Training Series Products/Atlas A3 Inference Series Products | >= CANN 9.0.0 |
| Atlas A2 Training Series Products/Atlas A2 Inference Series Products | >= CANN 9.0.0 |

## Build and Run
Run the following steps in the root directory of this example to build and run the example.
- Configure Environment Variables  
  Configure environment variables based on the [installation method](../../../../../docs/zh/quick_start.md#prepare&install) of the CANN development kit in the current environment.
  ```bash
  source ${install_path}/cann/set_env.sh
  ```

  > **Note:** `${install_path}` is the CANN package installation directory. When no installation directory is specified, the default installation path is `/usr/local/Ascend`.

- Run the Example

  Run the following commands in the example directory.
  ```bash
  mkdir -p build && cd build;    # Create and enter the build directory
  cmake -DCMAKE_ASC_ARCHITECTURES=dav-2201 ..;make -j;    # Build the project, npu mode by default
  python3 ../scripts/gen_data.py    # Generate test input data
  ./demo                        # Run the compiled executable to execute the example
  python3 ../scripts/verify_result.py output/output.bin output/golden.bin    # Verify whether the output is correct and confirm the algorithm logic
  ```

  To use CPU debug or NPU simulation mode, add the `-DCMAKE_ASC_RUN_MODE=cpu` or `-DCMAKE_ASC_RUN_MODE=sim` parameter.

  Examples:
  ```bash
  cmake -DCMAKE_ASC_RUN_MODE=cpu -DCMAKE_ASC_ARCHITECTURES=dav-2201 ..;make -j; # CPU debug mode
  cmake -DCMAKE_ASC_RUN_MODE=sim -DCMAKE_ASC_ARCHITECTURES=dav-2201 ..;make -j; # NPU simulation mode
  ```

  > **Notice:** Clear the cmake cache before switching build modes. Run `rm CMakeCache.txt` in the build directory and then re-run cmake.

- Build Option Description

  | Option | Values | Description |
  | ----------------| -----------------------------| ---------------------------------------------------|
  | `CMAKE_ASC_RUN_MODE` | `npu` (default), `cpu`, `sim` | Run mode: NPU run, CPU debug, NPU simulation |
  | `CMAKE_ASC_ARCHITECTURES` | `dav-2201` (default), `dav-3510` | NPU architecture: dav-2201 corresponds to Atlas A2 Training Series Products/Atlas A2 Inference Series Products and Atlas A3 Training Series Products/Atlas A3 Inference Series Products, dav-3510 corresponds to Ascend 950PR/Ascend 950DT |

- Execution Result

  The following output indicates a successful accuracy comparison:
  ```bash
  test pass!
  ```
