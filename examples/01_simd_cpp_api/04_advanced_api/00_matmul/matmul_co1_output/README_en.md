# Matmul Self-Managed CO1 Direct Invocation Example
## Overview
A Matmul example where the user manages CO1 (L0C Buffer) independently. The computation result C matrix is stored in the CO1 position, and then the basic API Fixpipe is called to transfer the result from CO1 to Global Memory.

## Supported Products and CANN Versions

| Product | CANN Version |
|------|-------------|
| Atlas A3 Training Series Products/Atlas A3 Inference Series Products | >= CANN 9.0.0 |
| Atlas A2 Training Series Products/Atlas A2 Inference Series Products | >= CANN 9.0.0 |

## Build and Run
Run the following steps in the root directory of this example to build and run the example.
- Configure Environment Variables  
  Configure environment variables based on the [installation method](../../../../../docs/quick_start.md#prepare&install) of the CANN development kit in the current environment.
  ```bash
  source ${install_path}/cann/set_env.sh
  ```

  > **Note:** `${install_path}` is the CANN package installation directory. When no installation directory is specified, the default installation path is `/usr/local/Ascend`.

- Run the Example

  Run the following commands in the example directory.
  ```bash
  mkdir -p build && cd build;    # Create and enter the build directory
  cmake -DCMAKE_ASC_ARCHITECTURES=dav-2201 ..;make -j;    # Build the project, npu mode by default
  python3 ../scripts/gen_data.py    # Generate test input data
  ./demo                        # Run the compiled executable to execute the example
  python3 ../scripts/verify_result.py output/output.bin output/golden.bin    # Verify whether the output is correct and confirm the algorithm logic
  ```

  To use CPU debug or NPU simulation mode, add the `-DCMAKE_ASC_RUN_MODE=cpu` or `-DCMAKE_ASC_RUN_MODE=sim` parameter.

  Examples:
  ```bash
  cmake -DCMAKE_ASC_RUN_MODE=cpu -DCMAKE_ASC_ARCHITECTURES=dav-2201 ..;make -j; # CPU debug mode
  cmake -DCMAKE_ASC_RUN_MODE=sim -DCMAKE_ASC_ARCHITECTURES=dav-2201 ..;make -j; # NPU simulation mode
  ```

  > **Notice:** Clear the cmake cache before switching build modes. Run `rm CMakeCache.txt` in the build directory and then re-run cmake.

- Build Option Description

  | Option | Values | Description |
  | ----------------| -----------------------------| ---------------------------------------------------|
  | `CMAKE_ASC_RUN_MODE` | `npu` (default), `cpu`, `sim` | Run mode: NPU run, CPU debug, NPU simulation |
  | `CMAKE_ASC_ARCHITECTURES` | `dav-2201` (default) | NPU architecture: dav-2201 corresponds to Atlas A2 Training Series Products/Atlas A2 Inference Series Products and Atlas A3 Training Series Products/Atlas A3 Inference Series Products |
- Execution Result

  The following output indicates a successful accuracy comparison:
  ```bash
  test pass!
  ```
