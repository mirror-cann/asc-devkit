## Example Description

A complete matrix multiplication involves the following data transfer process: GM -> L1, L1 -> L0A / L0B, L1 -> BT (BiasTable Buffer), L0C -> GM. The data layout formats in different storage units are shown in Table 1 below:

The general matrix multiplication formula: C = A x B + Bias, where A, B, Bias, C matrices must satisfy shapes [M,K], [K,N], [N] and [M,N] respectively. The correspondence between Bias data type and C matrix data type is shown in Table 2, where combinations using bfloat16 for Bias on GM/L1 are only supported on Ascend 950PR/Ascend 950DT.

### Scenario Details

  This example selects different output scenarios through the compilation parameter `SCENARIO_NUM`. All scenarios are based on the same matrix multiplication specification: [M, N, K] = [30, 40, 70], with kernel function name `mmad_custom`.

**Scenario 1: int8_t input, int32_t output, C matrix initial value from C2**
- Input:
  - A not transposed [30, 70] int8_t type, ND format
  - B not transposed [70, 40] int8_t type, ND format
  - Bias [1, 40] int32_t type
- Output: C [30, 40] int32_t type, ND format
- Implementation: Use `Mmad` for matrix multiplication, without passing biasTensor, set C matrix initial value from C2 through parameters: `mmadParams.cmatrixInitVal = false, mmadParams.cmatrixSource = true`.
- Description: For int8_t type input with B matrix not transposed, the N axis aligns to 2 * 16, filling a 32 * 16 fractal with all invalid data. As shown in Figure 1 below, if `mmadParams.n = N` is set, it would read fractals numbered 3 and 7 while failing to read fractals numbered 9 and 10 that contain valid data. Therefore, set: `mmadParams.n = CeilAlign(N, BLOCK_CUBE * fractalNum)`, which reads all fractals. Although the matrix computation result includes results from invalid data participation, the Fixpipe instruction ensures that results from invalid data are not transferred out by setting `fixpipeParams.nSize = N` during data transfer.

**Scenario 2: bfloat16 input, float output, A not transposed, B transposed, C matrix initial value from CO1**
- Input:
  - A not transposed [30, 70] bfloat16 type, ND format
  - B transposed [40, 70] bfloat16 type, ND format
- Output: C [30, 40] float type, ND format
- Implementation: Use `Mmad` for matrix multiplication, set C matrix initial value from CO1 through parameters: `mmadParams.cmatrixInitVal = false, mmadParams.cmatrixSource = false`
- Description: This scenario performs two Mmad computations, with the first computation result stored in CO1 as the C matrix initial value for the next computation, ultimately accumulating both Mmad computation results.

**Scenario 3: float input, float output, A transposed, B transposed, biasTensor passed, kDirectionAlign set to true**
- Input:
  - A transposed [70, 30] float type, ND format
  - B transposed [40, 70] float type, ND format
  - Bias [1, 40] float type
- Output: C [30, 40] float type, ND format
- Implementation: Use `Mmad` for matrix multiplication, pass biasTensor, `mmadParams.cmatrixSource` parameter is not applicable in this scenario
- Description: For float type input with A matrix transposed, `mmadParams.kDirectionAlign` is needed to resolve the issue where the K axis actually aligns to `CeilAlign(K, 8*2)` but the Mmad instruction defaults to `CeilAlign(K, 8)`. In this scenario, this parameter is set to true, K axis aligns to `CeilAlign(K, 16)`, and the matrix computation unit skips filled invalid data when reading from L0A. In other scenarios, this parameter defaults to false, and K axis aligns to `CeilAlign(K, 8)`, as shown in Figure 2 below:

<p align="center">

</p>

**Scenario 4: int4b_t input, int32_t output, C matrix initial value is 0, only supported on Atlas A3 Training Series Products/Atlas A3 Inference Series Products and Atlas A2 Training Series Products/Atlas A2 Inference Series Products**

- Input:
  - A not transposed [30, 70] int4b_t type, ND format
  - B transposed [40, 70] int4b_t type, ND format
- Output: C [30, 40] int32_t type, ND format
- Implementation: Use `Mmad` for matrix multiplication, set C matrix initial value to 0 through parameter: `mmadParams.cmatrixInitVal = true`
- Description: This scenario does not support adding Bias by passing biasTensor (Scenario 3).

### Matrix Multiplication (Mmad)

The following describes how to configure the members of the MmadParams structure for the Mmad instruction. The specific meaning of each member variable is not repeated here.

Note that when executing the Mmad instruction, the matrix computation unit continuously reads multiple fractals from L0A/L0B to participate in matrix multiplication computation. The number of fractals read is determined by the values of MmadParams structure members m, n, k, and the alignment requirements of the Mmad instruction for A and B matrix axes on L0A/L0B.

Taking b16 input type as an example, the Mmad instruction reads data continuously according to A matrix fractal [16, 16] and B matrix fractal [16, 16]. At this point, the total number of fractals read by the matrix computation unit from L0A/L0B are 2 x 5 = 10 and 5 x 3 = 15 respectively, and the total number of fractals written to L0C is 2 x 3 = 6. As shown in the figures below, Figure 3 corresponds to Atlas A3 Training Series Products/Atlas A3 Inference Series Products and Atlas A2 Training Series Products/Atlas A2 Inference Series Products, Figure 4 corresponds to Ascend 950PR/Ascend 950DT; the two differ in data layout on L0A, the former being Zz and the latter being Nz.

The Mmad computation includes padded invalid data, which needs to be excluded during the L0C to GM transfer process by the Fixpipe instruction, eliminating the invalid data filled during Mmad computation.
