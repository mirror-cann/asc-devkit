# GroupBarrier Example

## Overview

This example implements correct synchronization between two groups of AIVs with dependencies. After Group A AIVs complete computation, Group B AIVs depend on the computation results of Group A AIVs for subsequent computation. Group A is called the Arrive group, and Group B is called the Wait group.

> **Notice:** This example is only applicable to the TPipe and TQue programming model.

## Example Description

- Example function:
  The GroupBarrier example implements correct synchronization between two groups of AIVs with dependencies. After Group A AIVs complete computation, Group B AIVs depend on the computation results of Group A AIVs for subsequent computation. Group A is called the Arrive group, and Group B is called the Wait group. This example does not perform input/output computation. Instead, after the Arrive group writes specified values, the Wait group reads those values and prints the correct values via printf to complete verification.

- Example implementation:

  The GroupBarrier example enables 8 AIV cores. 2 AIV cores serve as the Arrive group, enabling atomic accumulation, writing specified values to Global Memory, and calling the Arrive instruction. The remaining 6 AIV cores first call the Wait instruction to wait for the Arrive group to complete writing, then read from Global Memory and print the results via printf.

## Build and Run

Run the following steps in the root directory of this example to build and run the example.

- Configure environment variables
  Configure environment variables according to the [installation method](../../../../../docs/zh/quick_start.md#prepare&install) of the CANN development kit in the current environment.
  ```bash
  source ${install_path}/cann/set_env.sh
  ```

  > **Note:** `${install_path}` is the CANN package installation directory. When no installation directory is specified, the default installation path is `/usr/local/Ascend`.

- Run the example

  Run the following commands in the example directory.
  ```bash
  mkdir -p build && cd build;      # Create and enter the build directory
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_ASC_ARCHITECTURES=dav-2201;make -j;    # Build the project
  ./demo                           # Run the compiled executable to execute the example
  ```

  To use NPU simulation mode, add the `-DCMAKE_ASC_RUN_MODE=sim` parameter.

  Example:

  ```bash
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_ASC_RUN_MODE=sim -DCMAKE_ASC_ARCHITECTURES=dav-2201;make -j; # NPU simulation mode
  ```

  > **Notice:** Clear the cmake cache before switching build modes. Run `rm CMakeCache.txt` in the build directory and then re-run cmake.

- Build option description

  | Option | Values | Description |
  |--------|--------|-------------|
  | `CMAKE_ASC_RUN_MODE` | `npu` (default), `sim` | Run mode: NPU execution, NPU simulation |
  | `CMAKE_ASC_ARCHITECTURES` | `dav-2201` (default), `dav-3510` |  NPU architecture: dav-2201 corresponds to Atlas A2 Training Series Products/Atlas A2 Inference Series Products and Atlas A3 Training Series Products/Atlas A3 Inference Series Products, dav-3510 corresponds to Ascend 950PR/Ascend 950DT |

- Execution result

  The following execution result indicates that the example executed successfully.

  ```bash
  [Block (0/6)]: OUTPUT = 24
  [Block (1/6)]: OUTPUT = 24
  [Block (2/6)]: OUTPUT = 24
  [Block (3/6)]: OUTPUT = 24
  [Block (4/6)]: OUTPUT = 24
  [Block (5/6)]: OUTPUT = 24
  ```
