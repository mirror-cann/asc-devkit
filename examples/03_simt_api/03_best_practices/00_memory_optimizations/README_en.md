# Memory Optimizations Example Introduction

## Overview

Using memory access optimization with direct `<<<>>>` invocation, this section introduces memory access tuning approaches based on  SIMT programming, including global memory access coalescing, on-chip cache reuse (e.g., UB), Bank conflict avoidance, and improving memory bandwidth utilization via short vector such as half2.
