# SIMT Programming Reduction Sum Example

## Overview

This example implements reduction sum for 1D `float` input based on the Ascend C SIMT programming model. Through 2 progressive scenarios, it demonstrates typical usage of intra-block synchronization and inter-block memory ordering control.

The 2 scenarios correspond to reduction sum for small shape input and large shape input respectively, focusing on the usage of [`asc_syncthreads()`](https://gitcode.com/cann/asc-devkit/blob/master/docs/zh/api/SIMT-API/同步与内存栅栏/同步接口/asc_syncthreads.md) and [`asc_threadfence()`](https://gitcode.com/cann/asc-devkit/blob/master/docs/zh/api/SIMT-API/同步与内存栅栏/内存栅栏接口/asc_threadfence.md) under different reduction scales.

This example controls build branches through `SCENARIO_NUM`. The 2 scenarios are classified by input scale: Scenario 1 demonstrates reduction sum and `asc_syncthreads()` synchronization usage for small shape input. When the number of input elements is small, only 1 block is needed to cover all data, and no inter-block synchronization is required. Scenario 2 extends to multi-block segmented reduction for large shape input, introducing `asc_threadfence()` for inter-block merging.

### Example Specifications

#### SCENARIO_NUM=1 (Small Shape Reduction Scenario)

- Example Function:

  Perform **reduction sum** on 1024 `float` input elements within a single thread block.

  </table>

- Data Partitioning:

  - gridDim: (1, 1, 1)
  - blockDim: (1024, 1, 1)
  - Per-thread processing: 1 input element

#### SCENARIO_NUM=2 (Large Shape Reduction Scenario)

- Example Function:

  Perform **segmented reduction sum** on `1024 * 1024` `float` input elements. Each thread block first completes the **partial sum** for its assigned segment, then a single thread block performs a second reduction sum on all thread block partial sums to obtain the final total.

### Example Implementation

#### 1: Small Shape Reduction Scenario

Each thread in a single thread block first reads one input element, then obtains the final result through **two-phase reduction sum**:

- **Phase 1 (intra-warp reduction)**: Call the [`asc_reduce_add()`](https://gitcode.com/cann/asc-devkit/blob/master/docs/zh/api/SIMT-API/Warp函数/Warp-Reduce类函数/asc_reduce_add.md) interface to perform reduction on all thread values within the current warp, obtaining the sum of data within the warp, and write to shared memory.
- **Phase 2 (block-level sequential accumulation)**: After cross-warp synchronization, thread 0 sequentially accumulates the partial sums from each warp to obtain the final result.

Taking 128 elements (4 warps) as an example, the two-phase reduction process is shown in Figure 1:

  <img src="./figures/两阶段归约求和.png" width="50%">
   </p>
<p align="center">
Figure 1: Two-phase reduction process illustration
</p>

In Phase 1, each warp completes intra-warp summation through `asc_reduce_add()` and writes the result to shared memory. In Phase 2, thread 0 sequentially reads the partial sums from each warp and accumulates them to obtain the final result. Between the two phases, `asc_syncthreads()` must be called for synchronization.

`asc_syncthreads()` is used to block all threads in the current thread block until all threads reach the synchronization point. In this scenario, `asc_syncthreads()` ensures that the first thread of each warp has already written the intra-warp reduction result to shared memory, so that the subsequent block-level sequential accumulation can read complete shared memory data.

#### 2: Large Shape Reduction Scenario

When the total number of input elements is large, **multiple thread blocks** are needed for segmented processing.

Each thread block first completes the two-phase partial reduction described above within the block, then the thread with `tid = 0` writes the block's partial sum to `block_sums[blockIdx.x]`. After writing, `asc_threadfence()` is executed, and then the global counter is incremented by 1. The last thread block to increment the counter (that is, the thread block with `ticket = gridDim.x - 1`) reads `block_sums` and performs a second two-phase reduction to output the final result.

Taking 8 thread blocks as an example, the inter-block coordination process is shown in Figure 2:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./figures/跨线程块协作.png" width="75%">
   </p>
<p align="center">
Figure 2: Inter-block coordination process illustration
</p>

In the above flow, multiple thread blocks need to read and write the same global memory `block_sums`, which may cause data races.

`asc_threadfence()` serves as an inter-core memory barrier, ensuring that all global memory and shared memory write operations before `asc_threadfence()` by the calling thread are visible to other threads, and that these write operations are not reordered after the memory barrier. Therefore, each thread block must execute in the following order: write partial sum to `block_sums` -> increment atomic counter. This order ensures that when the last thread block reads `block_sums` to perform global reduction, it will definitely see all partial sums already written by other thread blocks. If `asc_threadfence()` is omitted, stale data may be read, causing incorrect results.
