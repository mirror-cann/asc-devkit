# Quick Start

## 🛠️ Environment Preparation<a name="prepare&install"></a>

Choose the appropriate environment preparation method based on **whether you have an NPU device locally** and **your usage goal**:

| Environment Preparation | Community Experience / Operator Development (CANN Commercial/Community Edition) | Ecosystem Developer Contribution (CANN master) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **No NPU device** | [Cloud Development Environment](#1️⃣-cloud-development-environment) | [Manually Download and Install CANN master](#📥-download-and-install-cann-package) + [Cloud Development Environment](#1️⃣-cloud-development-environment) |
| **Have NPU device** | [CANN Official Docker Image](#2️⃣-cann-official-docker-image) | [Manually Download and Install CANN master](#📥-download-and-install-cann-package) + [Dev Container](#3️⃣-devcontainer) |

> [!TIP] Recommendations
>
> - To ensure development environment quality, we recommend users complete **environment preparation** based on **containerization technology**.
> - If you prefer not to use containers, you can also complete **environment preparation** on a host with NPU device. Refer to [CANN Software Installation Guide - Install on Physical Machine](https://www.hiascend.com/cann/download).
> - For users who only want to experience "compile and install this open source repository + run operators in simulation environment", the host does not require an NPU device. You can skip NPU driver and firmware installation and directly install the CANN package. Refer to [Download and Install CANN Package](#📥-download-and-install-cann-package).

### 1️⃣ Cloud Development Environment

For users without NPU devices, you can use the NPU computing resources provided by the **cloud development environment** for development experience. The **cloud development environment** provides an online directly runnable Ascend ARM architecture environment. Currently only applicable to Atlas A2 series products, it provides two access methods:

- **WebIDE Development Platform**, that is "**One-stop Development Platform**", provides web-based portable development experience.
- **VSCode IDE**, supports remote connection to **cloud development environment**, provides VSCode powerful plugin marketplace support.

1. Go to the open source repository Gitcode page and click the "`Cloud Development`" button. Log in with a verified Huawei Cloud account. If not registered or verified, follow the page prompts to register and verify.

   <p align="center"><img src="../zh/figures/cloudIDE.png" alt="Cloud Platform" width="750px" height="90px"></p>

2. Follow the page prompts to create and start the cloud development environment. Click "`Connect > WebIDE or Visual Studio Code`" to enter the cloud development environment. Open source project resources are in the `/mnt/workspace` directory by default.

   <p align="center"><img src="../zh/figures/webIDE.png" alt="Cloud Platform" width="1000px" height="150px"></p>

> [!NOTE] Usage Instructions
>
> - The environment has the latest commercial NPU driver and firmware, CANN package pre-installed. Pay attention to software compatibility when downloading source code.
> - To download a specific version of CANN package, refer to [Download and Install CANN Package](#📥-download-and-install-cann-package).
> - For more information about **WebIDE Development Platform**, refer to [Cloud Development Platform Introduction](https://gitcode.com/org/cann/discussions/54).
> - [Huawei Developer Space plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HuaweiCloud.developerspace) provides technical support for VSCode IDE to access **cloud development environment**.

### 2️⃣ CANN Official Docker Image

For users with NPU devices, you can use the CANN official Docker image for development experience.

1. Verify host environment

   - Check if NPU driver and firmware are installed. Use `npu-smi info` to output NPU information. If not installed, refer to [CANN Software Installation Guide - Install on Physical Machine](https://www.hiascend.com/cann/download).
   - Check if Docker is installed. Use `docker --version` to output Docker version information. If not installed, refer to [Docker Official Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

2. Download CANN image

    Pull the CANN pre-integrated image from [Ascend Image Repository](https://www.hiascend.com/developer/ascendhub/detail/17da20d1c2b6493cb38765adeba85884):

    ```bash
    # Example: ascend/cann:tag is 9.0.0-beta.2 CANN community package
    # docker pull swr.cn-south-1.myhuaweicloud.com/ascendhub/cann:9.0.0-beta.2-910b-ubuntu22.04-py3.11
    docker pull <ascend/cann:tag>
    ```

    > [!NOTE] Usage Instructions
    > - The image has the corresponding version of CANN package pre-installed. Pay attention to software compatibility when downloading source code.
    > - The image file is relatively large. Under normal network speed, download time is about 5-10 minutes. Please wait patiently.

3. Run Docker

    After pulling the image, you need to start with specific parameters so that the container can access the host's NPU device.

    ```bash
    docker run --name <cann_container> \
        --ipc=host --net=host --privileged \
        --device /dev/davinci0 \
        --device /dev/davinci_manager \
        --device /dev/devmm_svm \
        --device /dev/hisi_hdc \
        -v /usr/local/dcmi:/usr/local/dcmi \
        -v /usr/local/bin/npu-smi:/usr/local/bin/npu-smi \
        -v /usr/local/Ascend/driver/lib64/:/usr/local/Ascend/driver/lib64/ \
        -v /usr/local/Ascend/driver/version.info:/usr/local/Ascend/driver/version.info \
        -v /etc/ascend_install.info:/etc/ascend_install.info \
        -v </home/your_host_dir>:</home/your_container_dir> \

### 3️⃣ DevContainer

For users with NPU devices, we recommend using DevContainer for ecosystem developer contribution.

DevContainer is based on VS Code Dev Containers. It automatically builds a consistent containerized development environment through `.devcontainer` configuration in the repository. It has built-in `conda`, `Python` and other development toolchains. It shares device access with the host's NPU driver, suitable for scenarios that require compiling source code, running UT, and contributing code to this repository. For detailed instructions, refer to [`.devcontainer/README_en.md`](../../.devcontainer/README_en.md).

> [!NOTE] Usage Instructions
> DevContainer only mounts the host's NPU driver (read-only). **CANN toolkit and ops packages need to be manually installed after container starts**. Refer to [Download and Install CANN Package](#📥-download-and-install-cann-package).

### 📥 Download and Install CANN Package<a name="cann-install"></a>
