 * @class Hccl
 * @brief This class mainly provides a series of collection communication primitive interfaces (hence Prepare),
 *        benchmarking against Huawei's collection communication C++ interface, including AllReduce,AllGather,
 *        ReduceScatter and so on.
 *        The typical usage of this class is as follows:
 *          1) Create Hccl object and initialize it.
 *          2) Launch comm tasks asynchronously through the corresponding Prepare interface,
 *             and the server starts assembling and launching comm tasks as soon as it listens.
 *          3) Call the Commit interface to notify the execution of the corresponding comm task.
 *          4) Call the Wait interface (blocking) to wait for the server to complete the corresponding comm task.
 *          5) Call the Finalize interface to notify the server that there will be no comm tasks in the future.
 *             Once all comm tasks are executed, server can exit.
 *        On Atlas A2 训练系列产品/Atlas A2 推理系列产品/Ascend 910_93, users must specify whether
 *        the interface runs on the AICube core or the AIVector core when calling interfaces in class Hccl.
 * @tparam serverType: Only HcclServerType::HCCL_SERVER_TYPE_AICPU supported.
 *         config: The configuration for the HCCL instance.
