 * @class Hcomm
 * @brief This class mainly provides a series of point-to-point communication primitive interfaces,
 *        benchmarking against Huawei's point-to-point communication C++ interface,
 *        including WriteNbi、ReadNbi and so on.
 *        The typical usage of this class is as follows:
 *          1) Create Hcomm object.
 *          2) Initialize communication channel.
 *          3) Launch comm tasks asynchronously through the corresponding interface,
 *             and the server starts assembling and launching comm tasks as soon as it listens.
 *          4) If commit is false when launching task, call the Commit interface to notify the execution of the
 * corresponding comm task. 5) Call the Drain interface (blocking) to wait for the server to complete the corresponding
 * comm task.
 * @tparam commProtocol: The communication protocol to use, ROCE supported as default.
